            <h4 class="name-character">RICK S√ÅNCHEZ</h4>
            <p>
              A sociopathic, nihilistic, grouchy, crude, rude, narcissistic,
              self-centered, alcoholic mad scientist who is the widow father of
              Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer

            <h4 class="name-character">MORTY SMITH</h4>
            <p>
              Is Rick's neurotic 14-year-old grandson who is frequently dragged
              into Rick's misadventures. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he
              often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and morally
              questionable methods Rick uses to 'fix' situations.

            <h4 class="name-character">JERRY SMITH</h4>
            <p>
              Is Summer and Morty's insecure 34-year-old father, Beth's husband,
              and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's
              influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level
              advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence.

            <p>
              Is Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife.
              She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she
              internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her
              career is compared to human medicine.

            <h4 class="name-character">SUMMER SMITH</h4>
            <p>
              Is Morty's 17-year-old (18 after season 5) older sister, a more
              conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with
              improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar
              to her mother, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's
              approval-seeking.

            <p>
              Yellow humanoid creature and longtime family friend. He is a
              parody of wacky side characters on television shows. Although he
              shows up at the same time as a group of Alien Parasites who take
              the forms of similarly zany characters, Mr. Poopybutthole himself
              is real.
