        <h4>RICK SANCHEZ</h4>
        <p>
          A sociopathic, nihilistic, grouchy, crude, rude, narcissistic,
          self-centered, alcoholic mad scientist who is the widow father of Beth
          Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer

        <h4>MORTY SMITH</h4>
        <p>
          Is Rick's neurotic 14-year-old grandson who is frequently dragged into
          Rick's misadventures. Morty is good natured but he is easily
          distressed. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he often
          ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and morally questionable methods
          Rick uses to 'fix' situations.

        <h4>JERRY SMITH</h4>
        <p>
          Is Summer and Morty's insecure 34-year-old father, Beth's husband, and
          Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over
          his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until
          he was fired for incompetence.

        <h4>BETH SMITH</h4>
        <p>
          Is Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife. She
          is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she
          internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her
          career is compared to human medicine.

        <img src="./img/5.jpg" alt="" />
        <h4>SUMMER SMITH</h4>
        <p>
          Is Morty's 17-year-old (18 after season 5) older sister, a more
          conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with
          improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to
          her mother, as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but
          she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking.

        <h4>MR. POOPYBUTTHOLE</h4>
        <p>
          Yellow humanoid creature and longtime family friend. He is a parody of
          wacky side characters on television shows. Although he shows up at the
          same time as a group of Alien Parasites who take the forms of
          similarly zany characters, Mr. Poopybutthole himself is real.
